        "0. Ask all the participants of your Zoom meeting to confirm their presence by writing in the public chat at the beginning and - if you prefer to do so - at the end of your Zoom meeting (e.g., ask them to write \"present!\"). The recommended Zoom login format is \"Name Surname\".\n",
        "1. Export `chat.txt` file from a Zoom meeting.\n",
        "2. If in Google Colab, drop `chat.txt` file from Zoom to `Files` in the left-hand side panel. (Copy it to the folder containing the `main.py` file when using your own machine. You may also source it in any other way.)\n",
        "3. Run the program.\n",
        "4. If needed, specify cut-off times for attendance (maximum and minimum time of a message sent in the public chat).\n",
